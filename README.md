# Hybrid Deep Learning Model To Predict Credict Card Fault

In this project I have used Supervised and Unsupervised approaches of Deep Learning for credit card fault detection. 
We first use Self Organizing Maps (SOM) to label each of the users as 'Fraud' or 'Not a Fraud'. SOMs are an Unsupervised approach of Deep Learning, wherein the key features of the data are represented by the main neurons in a 2-D format. The maps are built on the condition that each of the main nodes is brought closer to the feature that it is trying to represent. 
In the second phase of the project, we use Artificial Neural Networks to predict the probability of fault for each of the users, using a Supervised approach, wherein the labels assigned by the SOMs are used as a target variable for the training.
